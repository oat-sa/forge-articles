Overview
--------

### 1. The content

A delivery defines a sequence of tests to be delivered, the same way as a test contains a number of items.

The diagram below sums up the relationship between deliveries, tests and items.

### 2. The context

On top of that, it allows defining the conditions and the context of tests delivery.

The following issues are addressed:

-   When can it be delivered?
-   Who can execute it?
-   How many times can it be executed by allowed test takers?
-   Where are the results uploaded?

The delivery model on the Generis representation below shows the properties of the delivery resource class:

Please refer the Delivery server|delivery server section to see how this properties apply on delivery execution
