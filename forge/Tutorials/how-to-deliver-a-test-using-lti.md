### in Moodle as administrator
- Go to *Site administration* and open *Plugins* (under advanced features) -> *Activity modules* -> *Manage activities*
- Open *Settings* of the *External Tools* and click on *Add external tool configuration*
- Name your configuration and enter the same Consumer Key and Shared Secret that you used in TAO
- The Tool Base URL is TAO_ROOT_URL + *'/ltiDeliveryProvider/DeliveryTool/launch'*.
 (If you don't know the url of your TAO installation then return to the TAO Back Office home, look at your url and remove 'tao/Main/index'.
 So if your TAO home is 'http://localhost/tao24/tao/Main/index' then your root url would be 'http://localhost/tao24/'.)
- click on 'save Changes'
