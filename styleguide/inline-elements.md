# Inline Elements

> Element occupying only the space bounded by the tags that define this element

## Links
  
<a href="#">Hyperlinks</a> look like this. If they lead to <a href="#" rel="external"><span class="icon-external"></span> external sites</a> they should have a `rel="external"` for semantics. The arrow symbol is done with `span.icon-external`.  

## Bold Text</h2>

While semantically **bold text** should be done width `<strong>` elements, the same decoration can be achieved with `<b>` or `.b` and `.strong`.
  
## Italic text</h2>
  
Obviously *italic text* should be done with an `<em>` element, but again the same decoration can be achieved with `<i>` or `.i` and `.em`. 

## Code
`Source code` will be written in a monospaced font.
