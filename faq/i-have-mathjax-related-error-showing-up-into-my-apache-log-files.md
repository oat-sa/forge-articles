#I have MathJax related error showing up into my apache log files ? 

MathJax is an optional component. TAO produces this error if this components hasn't been installed. Installing MathJax will remove those messages but is not mandatory if you don’t need math capabilities. https://github.com/oat-sa/taohub-articles/blob/master/articles/Third%20Party%20Tools%20and%20Libraries/enable-math.md
