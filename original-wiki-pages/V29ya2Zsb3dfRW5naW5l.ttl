h2. Overview

This extension provides the workflow engine to drive all workflow related resources in TAO, such as tests, deliveries or custom organizational processes. 
This extension uses a specific RDF model to describe a process, both at [[Process definition model|the definition]] and [[Execution of a process|the  execution]] level.
