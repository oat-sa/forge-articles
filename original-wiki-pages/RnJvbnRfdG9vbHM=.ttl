h1. Front tools

*These tools +are not required+ to run TAO, but can be helpful for client side development.*

h2. Grunt 

"Grunt":http://gruntjs.com/ helps you to automate tasks like require.js optimization, SASS compiling, test running, code linting, etc. 

Grunt runs on node.js, so you need "node.js":https://nodejs.org/en/download/ installed and running.

- For Linux user, you could install it easily node from a native package using "nodesource":https://github.com/nodesource/distributions
<pre>
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_6.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
</pre>

- If you want node only for your user, you can install it using "nvm":https://github.com/creationix/nvm
<pre>
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.31.1/install.sh | bash
nvm install v6.2.1
nvm alias default v6.2.1
</pre>

- The current SASS scripts used in TAO contains a bug, so we can't use the libsass until it is fixed. You need then to have the sass tool available on your system:
For Ubuntu/Debian user : 
<pre>
sudo apt-get install rubygems
sudo gem install sass
</pre>
For MacOS user, ruby comes installed to your system, you just have to install sass :
<pre>
gem install sass
</pre>


- Then to install and set up Grunt :
<pre>
npm install -g grunt-cli csso
cd tao/views/build
npm install
</pre>

Then you should be able to see available grunt tasks from the @tao/views/build@ directory:
<pre>
grunt --help
</pre>
