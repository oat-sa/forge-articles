h1. Change code

If you want changes to be integrated in a TAO release, please create an issue on the TAO Forge Tracker and attach your changes in the code as a patch. Patches respecting our coding [[Guidelines]] are very welcome. 
Some changes are more, or less, complex to integrate in the code. We have to run tests to avoid errors or side effects.
It will be dealt with as soon as possible.

"TAO Forum":http://forge.taotesting.com/projects/tao/boards is the better place to exchange about the best solution to improve the code. 
You can also contact us to discuss your ideas.
