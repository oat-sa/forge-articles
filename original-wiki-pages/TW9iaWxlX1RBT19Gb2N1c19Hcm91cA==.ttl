h2. Objectives

Our main objective is to make all QTI interactions that are currently implemented by Drag & Drop operations compliant with mobile platforms. These interactions are the following:

* "OrderInteraction":http://www.imsglobal.org/question/qtiv2p1/imsqti_infov2p1.html#element10283
* "AssociateInteraction":http://www.imsglobal.org/question/qtiv2p1/imsqti_infov2p1.html#element10291

h2. Process

The Mobile TAO Focus Group will engage an iterative process. Each iteration will be composed of multiple steps.

# *Implementation* of mobile support for a targeted subset of QTI Interactions.
# *Beta-testing* of already implemented interactions.
# *Collect* of issues/remarks among focus group members.

We would like to support as most interactions as we can at the end of these iterations.
