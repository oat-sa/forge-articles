h1. Maintenance

The TAO Platform provides a _Maintenance Mode_ aiming at helping administrators to shut down the system while maintaining it. To do so you need to change a _PHP constant_ in the Generis configuration file. It is located at _/generis/common/config.php_.

To set the system in _Maintenance Mode_, find the following constant and set it to _false_.

<pre>
<code class="php">
# application state
define('SYS_READY', false);</code>
</pre>

*Users* will then see the following page to be informed that the platform is under maintenance.

*Client scripts* will receive the following json 

<pre>
<code class="javascript">
{"success":false,"type":"Exception","message":"TAO is under maintenance","data":{"ExceptionType":"common_exception_SystemUnderMaintenance"}}</code>
</pre>

To make the system running again and available to your users, set the _SYS_READY_ constant to _true_.

<pre>
<code class="php">
# application state
define('SYS_READY', true);</code>
</pre>
