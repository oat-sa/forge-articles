!groups-editclass.png!

The Edit group class pane is displayed when a class is selected in the Groups library.

Here you can add, edit or delete the properties of a class.

By default, some properties are predefined, as they constitute the specification of a group: Members, Deliveries. They canâ€™t be edited or deleted.

You can add different type of properties: a short text, a date, a multiple choice list, etc.

-> For advanced users: you can create properties from widgets and all resources available on the platform (model, literal, container, etc.) in the Advanced mode.
