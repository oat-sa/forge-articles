h1. How to reference constants from other modules in your module

In TAO - there are several modules that use constants.php and you may need to reference these to get certain pieces of code to work properly.

h2. Step 1 - Create an includes folder in your module

As explained, navigate to your module and create a folder called includes

h2. Step 2 - Create a file in the includes folder called constants.php

You should now be able to see a file called <YOUR MODULE NAME>\includes\constants.php

h2. Step 3 - Add the following code

This is a sample to import the constants for TAO results

<pre>
<code class="XML">
<?php
require_once dirname(__FILE__). '/../../taoResultServer/includes/constants.php';
?>
</pre>
