h1. How to manage your Extensions

In this tutorial, we will focus on how to manage your TAO Extensions.

h2. 1. Introduction

TAO is a versatile product. It provides an Extension mechanism enabling you to fine tune your own TAO platform. We will focus on the discovery of dedicated tools that help you to install and configure TAO extensions. These tools are implemented as Command Line Interface (CLI) scripts, providing multiple _actions_ you can perform on your Extensions.

h2. 2. TaoExtensions script

The TAOExtensions script can be accessed by CLI on your web server. It is located at _PATH_TO_PLATFORM/tao/scripts/taoExtensions.php_. It provides multiple _actions_ you can call to install or configure your extensions.

h3. 2.1. setConfig action

The _setConfig_ action allows you to configure the behaviour of your Extensions. With this tool, you can change 3 different configuration parameters that are:

* *ghost* (boolean): the Extension has to be shown or not by the Graphical User Interface (GUI)

For instance, if you want the _taoCoding_ Extension to be shown in the TAO GUI, just type the following command.

<pre>
cd PATH_TO_PLATFORM/tao/scripts
php taoExtensions.php -v -u=user -p=password -a=setConfig -cP=ghost -cV=false -e=taoExtension
</pre>

Some information about this command:

* *-v* is the verbose mode _(boolean)_
* *-u* is the TAO backoffice user who will connect to the TAO API to acquire Database access _(string)_
* *-p* is the TAO backoffice password _(string)_
* *-a* is the action to perform. In this case, set a configuration parameter to a given value _(string)_
* *-cP* is the configuration parameter to change _(string)_
* *-cV* is the configuration value _(boolean)_
* *-e* is the extension your parameter will apply on _(string)_

h3. 2.2. install action

The _install_ action enables you to install a third-party extension on your existing TAO platform instance. The procedure is split in two steps.

h4. 2.2.1 Unzip your extension

Third-party extensions are packaged as ZIP archives. The first task you have to do is to unzip your extension in the root directory of your TAO installation, on the server-side. When done, you should find a directory named as the identifier of the extension. For instance, unzipping the _taoDocs_ extension will produce a _taoDocs_ folder in the root directory of your TAO installation.

h4. 2.2.1 Install your extension

You now have to invoke the _install_ action of the _TAOExtensions_ script to activate the extension. You will find below an example that installs the _taoDocs_ extension on your platform.

<pre>
cd PATH_TO_PLATFORM/tao/scripts
php taoExtensions.php -v -u=user -p=password -a=install -e=taoDocs
</pre>

where:

* *-v* is the verbose mode _(boolean)_
* *-u* is the TAO backoffice user who will connect to the TAO API to acquire Database access _(string)_
* *-p* is the TAO backoffice password _(string)_
* *-a* is the action to perform. In this situation, install an extension _(string)_
* *-e* is the identifier of the extension to install _(string)_
