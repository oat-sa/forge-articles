h2. Service definition box

* The Service definition box defines the services that will be integrated into an activity.
* The services are shared with every process which is in advanced mode e.g. modifying a service definition will affect every process that is using it.
-Question : modification aussi ailleurs ? + en attente documentation développeurs-

h2. Formal parameter box

* A service definition can receive input parameters (e.g. in case of a test delivery, a required parameter would be the subject’s id).

h2. Process variables box

h2. Process diagram box

* The Process diagram provides a process overview with these activities and the different types of connectors. It is possible to add activities and connectors directly in the diagram. All available actions in the diagram are already possible with the activity tree, on the right side of the interface. The main goal of the process diagram thus is to propose an alternative more visual of the creation tool of process.

h2. Activity editor box

* The Activity editor box allows creating activities and editing the connectors that define the workflow logic. The dynamic activity arborescence summarizes the workflow being edited. Every action can be done on the workflow with a right-click contextual menu.
