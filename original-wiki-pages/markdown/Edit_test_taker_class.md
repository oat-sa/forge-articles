=====================

![](testtakers-editclass.png)

The Edit test taker class pane is displayed when a class is selected in the Test takers library.

Here you can add, edit or delete the properties of a class.

By default, some properties are predefined, as they constitute the specification of a test taker: First name, Last name, Login, Mail, Default language, Interface language, Old password, New password and Repeat new password. They canâ€™t be edited or deleted.

You can add different type of properties: a short text, a date, a multiple choice list, etc.

-\> For advanced users: you can create properties from widgets and all resources available on the platform (model, literal, container, etc.) in the Advanced mode.
