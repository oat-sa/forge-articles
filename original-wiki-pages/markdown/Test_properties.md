Test properties
===============

![](Tests-properties.png)

The Test properties box is displayed when a test is selected in the Tests library.

The Test properties box provides the test properties which are defined in the parent classes properties and are available for modification.

The Active property defines if a test is active or not. If a test is not active, it cannot be included in a delivery.
