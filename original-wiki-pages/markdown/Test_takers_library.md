Test takers library
===================

![](testtakers-library.png)

The Test takers library provides a tree-view of the Test takers ![](Testtaker_icon_library.png) and classes ![](class_icon_library.png) you have created. All are contained in the “Test taker” root class.

You can move test takers in order to change their belonging class by drag and drop, or with the “Move” icon.

Different actions are available by right clicking (edit, new class, new test taker, move, duplicate, delete) depending on whether a class or a test taker is selected.

You can filter the Test takers library. Only the test takers and classes labels that meet the string enter in the text field will be displayed.
