Requirements for Tao 2.6
========================

Server-side
-----------

To manage and deliver TAO tests your web server will need to meet the following requirements:

-   Apache 2.2.x or 2.4.x
-   PHP 5.3 or higher
-   MySQL 5.0+ or PostgreSQL 7.0+

To achieve the best performance we recommend using a UNIX-based Operating System although TAO will also run on Apache on Windows.

The TAO platform requires a modern web browser with JavaScript enabled.
