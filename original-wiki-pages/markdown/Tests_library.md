Tests library
=============

![](tests-library.png)

The Tests library provides a tree-view of the tests ![](Test_icon_library.png) and classes ![](Class_icon_library.png) you have created. All are contained in the “Test” root class.

You can move tests in order to change their belonging class by drag and drop, or with the “Move” icon.

Different actions are available by right clicking (edit, new class, new test, move, duplicate, delete) depending on whether a class or a test is selected.

You can filter the Tests library. Only the tests and classes that contain the input strings in their label will be displayed.
