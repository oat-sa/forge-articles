Overview
--------

The main point of our approach is to use some ideas from the well known domain of CEP (Complex Event Processing) in order to establish a scoring solution.\
Since CEP is largely used in a lot of critical domains (such as the security, attack detection, business profilingâ€¦) we believe that the existing works in CEP can be an excellent source of inspiration that will help us in our approach.
