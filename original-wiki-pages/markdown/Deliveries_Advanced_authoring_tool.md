Service definition box
----------------------

-   The Service definition box defines the services that will be integrated into an activity.
-   The services are shared with every delivery which is in advanced mode, e.g. modifying a service definition will affect every delivery that is using it.\
    ~~Question : modification aussi dans processes et deliveries ? en attente de réponse~~\

Process diagram box
-------------------

-   The Process diagram provides a process overview with these activities and the different types of connectors. It is possible to add activities and connectors directly in the diagram. All available actions in the diagram are already possible with the activity tree, on the right side of the interface. The main goal of the process diagram thus is to propose an alternative more visual of the creation tool of process.\
