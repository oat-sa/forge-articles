Result servers library
======================

![](resultservers-library.png)

The Result Servers library provides a tree-view of the Result servers ![](Resultserver_icon_library.png) and classes ![](Class_icon_library.png) you have created. All are contained in the “Result Server” root class.

You can move results server in order to change their belonging class by drag and drop, or with the “Move” icon.

Different actions are available by right clicking (edit, new class, new result server, move, duplicate, delete) depending on whether a class or a result server is selected.

You can filter the Result Servers library. Only the result servers and classes labels that meet the string enter in the text field will be displayed.
