Objectives

Our main objective is to make all QTI interactions that are currently implemented by Drag & Drop operations compliant with mobile platforms. These interactions are the following:

-   [OrderInteraction](http://www.imsglobal.org/question/qtiv2p1/imsqti_infov2p1.html#element10283)
-   [AssociateInteraction](http://www.imsglobal.org/question/qtiv2p1/imsqti_infov2p1.html#element10291)

Process
-------

The Mobile TAO Focus Group will engage an iterative process. Each iteration will be composed of multiple steps.

1.  **Implementation** of mobile support for a targeted subset of QTI Interactions.
2.  **Beta-testing** of already implemented interactions.
3.  **Collect** of issues/remarks among focus group members.

We would like to support as most interactions as we can at the end of these iterations.
