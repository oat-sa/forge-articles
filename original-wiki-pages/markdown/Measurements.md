Measurements
============

introduced in [[TAO 2 2|TAO 2.2]]

Measurements allow us to describe the variables that will be created during the delivery of the item. This functionality allows the extension [[taoCoding]] to give additional informations to the graders on how to evaluate the test-takers answers.
