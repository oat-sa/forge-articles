Process diagram
===============

-   The Process diagram provides a process overview with these activities and the different types of connectors. It is possible to add activities and connectors directly in the diagram. All available actions in the diagram are already possible with the activity tree, on the right side of the interface. The main goal of the process diagram thus is to propose an alternative more visual of the creation tool of process.\
