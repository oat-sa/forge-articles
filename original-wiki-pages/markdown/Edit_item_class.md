Edit item class
===============

![](items_editclass.png)

The Edit item class pane is displayed when a class is selected in the Items library.

Here you can add, edit or delete the properties of a class. The items in this class will adopt these properties.

By default, some properties are already predefined, as they constitute the specification of an item: Item Versioned Content, Item content and Item model. They canâ€™t be edited or deleted.

You can add different type of properties: a short text, a date, a multiple choice list, etc.

-\> For advanced users: you can create properties from widgets and all resources available on the platform (model, literal, container, etc.) in the Advanced mode.
