h2. Objectives

The purpose of this logger is to improve the code by documenting errors or irregularities that might have been missed otherwise,
and by assisting developers in solving problems through offering insight into the events that led
to these errors.

h2. Usage

The common_Logger class offers a static interface for a log implementation. To spawn a log event you can call the static functions:

<pre><code class="php">
common_Logger::t('LOG MESSAGE', array(TAG1, TAG2));
</code></pre>

The function name corresponds to the first letter of the severity letter, which are from the least important to the most important:

* TRACE (0)
* DEBUG (1)
* INFO (2)
* WARNING (3)
* ERROR (4) 
* FATAL (5)

The first parameter consists of the error message to be logged, it should never be seen by the end-user and therefore is untranslated.

The second parameter consists of a string or an array of string, that allows us to tag log entries. Example tags are: INSTALL, CLEARFW, GENERIS, TAOITEMS, QTI

h2. Configuration

It is configured in the log config */generis/common/conf/log.conf.php* (which can be created by copying /generis/common/conf/default/log.conf.php to the conf folder) and declared as $GLOBALS['COMMON_LOGGER_CONFIG']

The decision which events should be logged will be taken by using either:
* *threshold*: indicates the minimum severity an event has to have in order to be logged using this appender
* *mask*: defines a bit mask, allowing a fine grained control over which events are logged, with the least significant
bit(2^0) corresponding to to the TRACE severity, and the most significant bit(2^5) corresponding to to the FATAL severity.
+Example+: To log everything except TRACE and WARNING, one would use 110110 = 32+16+4+2 = 54

In addition as of [[Tao 2 3|Tao 2.3]] items can also be filtered by tag with the following option:
* *tag*: an array of tags of which ONE tag must be used in the logitem

h3. SingleFileAppender

'file' => the absolute path to the logfile
'format' => the format of the log entry
'max_file_size' => maximum size a single log file can reach

upon reaching max_file_size, the first half of the log file will be deleted. Default is 1 MB, an entry of 0 disables this feature.

h4. ArchiveFileAppender

'file' => the absolute path to the logfile
'format' => the format of the log entry
'max_file_size' => maximum size a single logfile can reach
'directory' => directory to which logfiles will be archived to, once they reached max_file_size
'compression' => the compression algorithm to use for archived files, defaults to 'zip' only alternativ at the moment is 'none'

upon reaching max_file_size, the log file will be appended the current date and moved to the directory indicated by
the configuration parameter 'directory' if present or the same directory as the logfile if absent. If this file already exists
a serial number will be appended to the filename.

h3. XMLAppender

'file' => the absolute path to the logfile

this fileappender has no limit to it's size and should not yet be used in production

h3. UDPAppender

Warning: _enabling this appender on windows will require uncommenting 'extension=php_sockets.dll' in the php.ini_

'host' => destination host
'port' => destination port

the item is JSON formated and send via udp.

h2. Formats

h3. FileAppenders

The Fileappenders (SingelFileAppender, ArchiveFileAppender) append a String to the logfile that can contain the following  informations:
* %d datestring
* %m description(message)
* %s severity
* %r request
* %f file from which the log was called
* %l line from which the log was called
* %t timestamp
* %u user
* (%b backtrace)

The default format is: %d [%s] \'%m\' %f %l
resulting in: DATE [SEVERITY] MESSAGE ERRORFILE ERRORLINE

h3. XMLAppender

The XMLAppender inserts an xml item into the structure that has the following format:

<pre><code class="xml">
<xs:element name="event">
  <xs:complexType>
    <xs:sequence>
      <xs:element name="description" type="xs:string"/>
      <xs:element name="file" type="xs:string"/>
      <xs:element name="line" type="xs:string"/>
      <xs:element name="datetime" type="xs:string"/>
      <xs:element name="severity" type="xs:string"/>
      <xs:element name="user" type="xs:string"/>
    </xs:sequence>
  </xs:complexType>
</xs:element>
</code></pre>

h3. UDPAppender

sends an json encoded String of the following array structure:

<pre>
array(
    's' => SEVERITY (type int),
    'd' => DESCRIPTION (type string),
    't' => TAGS (type array),
    'f' => FILE (type string),
    'l' => LINE (type int),
    'b' => BACKTRACE (type array)
)
</pre>

the logitem will be packed into a json string, and send via UDP
