h1. Groups library


!groups-library.png!

The Groups library provides a tree-view of the groups !Group_icon_library.png! and classes !Class_icon_library.png! you have created. All are contained in the “Group” root class.

You can move groups in order to change their belonging class by drag and drop, or with the “Move” icon.

Different actions are available by right clicking (edit, new class, new group, move, duplicate, delete) depending on whether a class or a group is selected.

You can filter the Groups library. Only the groups and classes labels that meet the string enter in the text field will be displayed.
