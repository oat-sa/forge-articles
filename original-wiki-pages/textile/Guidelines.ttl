h1. Guidelines

h2. 1. Coding Standards

When contributing to TAO you must follow its coding standards. 

TAO decided to follow standards defined in "PSR-1":http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-1/ "PSR-2":http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/ and we start to update our autoload strategy to fit "PSR-4":http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-4/. New contributions may fullfill those requirements. 


h2. 2. Unit Testing

In order to try and improve code Quality for TAO we are using "PHP Unit":http://phpunit.de

h3 Installation and usage

"PHPUnit installation Guide and manual":http://phpunit.de/manual/current/en/installation.html

Class to extends to build your own test case [[GenerisPhpUnitTestRunner]] or [[TaoPhpUnitTestRunner]] depending where you are

A global testsuite is available in the root to launch all tests.

h3. Goals

* Test all classes 
* Test Isolated methods
* Avoid Non-regression, improve refactoring
* Run TestSuites very often
* Mostly Test logical part of the application 

h3. Principles

* One Class, one TestCase
* Test all non-trivial methods
* Build separate TestSuite for different parts of the application.
