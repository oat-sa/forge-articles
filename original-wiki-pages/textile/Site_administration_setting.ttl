h1. Site Administration Settings

The purpose of this section is to describe the settings needed to integrate the TAO instance in your infrastructure.

Most of these settings can be set into the main configuration file located at:
<pre>config/generis.conf.php</pre> or at
<pre>generis/common/config.php</pre>

bq. Be careful with the configuration settings. The default configuration has been tested but you should test your TAO instance once you have changed the configuration parameters. The main reason is that all combinations haven't been tested yet. 

h4. Common settings
 
• Change the database login and password:
<pre><code class="php">
define('DATABASE_LOGIN', true);
define('DATABSE_PASS', 'login');
</code></pre>

• The URL to access TAO:
<pre><code class="php">
define('ROOT_URL', 'http://mydomain.tld');
</code></pre>
• The path of TAO:
<pre><code class="php">
define('ROOT_PATH', '/var/www/');
</code></pre>


h4. HTTP Authentication
 
You can add an HTTP Authentication to protect your TAO instance. 
*The following example outlines how to establish a Basic HTTP Authentication to protect all the TAO instances with one account.* 
# Edit the file: @.htaccess@ at the root of the TAO folder.
# Add the following line at the beginning of the file (it's important to do it before the rewriting rules):
<pre><code>AuthName "Protected Area"
AuthType Basic
AuthUserFile "/var/opt/.htpassword"
Require valid-user
</code></pre>
# Create the password file using the command listed below. You can create it in the directory you want but consider these 2 security restrictions:
• the directoy (here /var/opt) must not be accessible via HTTP
• the apache user (usualy www-data) can read it, bot the other cannot
<pre>htpasswd -c login password</pre>
The @htpasswd@ command is provided by Apache. You can have a look at  "documentation page":http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/programs/htpasswd.html .

# Now you can reload your Apache server (if needed) and login with _login/password_ in the browser authentication box.

# The last step is to configure TAO to be aware of that authentication. So edit the main configuration file and set the value of the following constants:
<pre><code class="php">
define('USE_HTTP_AUTH', true);
define('USE_HTTP_USER', 'login');
define('USE_HTTP_PASS', 'password');
</code></pre>
