h1. Installing a new extension

Description on how to install extensions that are not part of the default TAO package. Some extensions are deprecated or experimental so please proceed at your own risk.

A list of released extensions can be found here: https://packagist.org/packages/oat-sa/

h2. Download

Depending on your install there are two different way to obtain an extension:

h3. Composer Install

If you installed TAO using composer simply run the following line in the root of TAO:

<pre>composer require PACKAGE_NAME</pre>

h3. Packaged Version

If you installed TAO from a package downloaded at http://www.taotesting.com you will need to:

* Download the extension from Github (https://github.com/oat-sa).
* Unzip the content and rename it according to the *tao-extension-name* specified in the composer.json. Place this renamed folder in the web root of TAO.
* Manually modify the composer autoloader.

For example: If the composer.json included
<pre>"psr-4" : {
    "oat\\SOMENAME\\" : ""
}</pre>

the following line would need to be added to _/vendor/composer/autoload_psr4.php_:

<pre><code class="php">'oat\\SOMENAME\\' => array($baseDir . '/SOMENAME'),</code></pre>

h2. Install

* Log into TAO as a System Administrator.
* Open the Extensions Manager (Under "Settings" in the upper right corner).
* Select the extension you downloaded and click on install. (If the extension is missing in the list please verify the path and the file permissions).
