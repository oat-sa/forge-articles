h1. Contribution Focus Groups

h2. Introduction

During our 2013 Tao-Days in Berne, a new initiative has been started to involve the community in the overall improvement of TAO. Five different focus groups on different topics of interest were created. Participation in a focus group is based on volunteership. Fellows interest in particopating may contact Lionel to register in a focus group. There are no specific requirements for particpating, you may help with your know how, use cases, content expertise or development skills. Each groups is being animated by a coordinator. The coordinator mission consists in documenting the activity of the focus group, upload materials on the wiki, coordinate the work efforts from members and coordinates meetings (Online).

If you think there is a topic of interest for the community an if you would like to initiate a new focus group and/or animate a focus group, please contact us.

h2. Tools

Each focus group should maintain a public wiki documentation including all materials. The coordinator will update the wiki with informal discussion exchanged in emails. The wiki page should include the objective, a description, the list of members, the planning and materials. 

The group may also use the forum. Depending on how the different groups evolve, more advanced collaborative work tool will be evaluated.
