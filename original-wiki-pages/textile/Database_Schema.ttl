h1. Database Schema

TAO and Generis need to use a storage engine even though it's transparent. By default, the storage back-end is "Mysql":http://www.mysql.com/, but it could be used over any relational database engine (eg. "Postgresql":http://www.postgresql.org/)

As you can see in the schema below, there are few tables only. 
Only these three are important:
* The _statements_ table which contains the triples. This is the main table: it contains the RDF(Resource Description Format)/RDFS triples ontologies representing the data (and the data model as a data itself).
* The _models_ table references the ontologies namespaces (_models_._modelID_ = _statements_._modelID_)
* The _extension_ table contains the list of TAO/Generis extensions.
